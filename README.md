# GeoIndex-based social networking site

Backend APIs of a geoIndex-based social network website project.
- The Go-based website provides "Create Image Post", "Nearby Posts in Map" and "Nearby Posts as Gallery" features.
- Utilized geolocation-based search of ElasticSearch on GCE to display nearby posts on a Google Maps instance.
- Used BigTable and GCS to store post content and images. The website is deployed to GAE for scalability.
